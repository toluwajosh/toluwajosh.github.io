# Deep Learning Style Transfer from Scratch

This is a project based course that teaches style transfer using [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning){:target="_blank"} and implemented in the [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/){:target="_blank"} framework.

There will be three tracks focusing on the level of understanding and patience of the student.

1. Just Run: If you want to see the finished project as soon as possible and work from top down.
2. Skim Through: This goes a little deeper to understand the gist of the project and allows the student to make few changes that affect the output of the project.
3. Deep Dive: This takes the project in details leaving no stone unturned in order to make use the student understand every part of the project.

## Features

1. The outlines and materials are heavily hyperlinked to related resources and explanations. This will make sure the student is never stuck on understanding and get help at any stage of the project.
2. End-to-end pipeline with one-come-run
3. Mentoring for students
4. Modular lessons structure to allow student to grasp an important understanding in each lesson.

## Course development stages

1. Class Audit: Open to handful trustees to test and help to improve the quality of the class content
2. Beta students: Cohorts zero, will be the first set of the program. Will gather first user feedback from this stage and use it to finalize the course.
3. Cohort Students: The final release of the class to the public.
