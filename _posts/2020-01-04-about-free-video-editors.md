I have spent some considerable time in the last 3 days looking for a quick, easy-to-use and FREE video editor. I have tested most of the recommended options on the internet;

- [Filmora](https://filmora.wondershare.com/){:target="_blank"},
- [KdenLive](https://kdenlive.org/en/){:target="_blank"},
- [Hitfilm Express](https://fxhome.com/hitfilm-express){:target="_blank"},
- [Lightworks](https://www.lwks.com/){:target="_blank"},
- [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/){:target="_blank"},
- [InShot (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.camerasideas.instashot&hl=en){:target="_blank"},
- [KineMaster (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexstreaming.app.kinemasterfree&hl=en){:target="_blank"},
- [FilmoraGo (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wondershare.filmorago&hl=en){:target="_blank"},
- [PowerDirector (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyberlink.powerdirector.DRA140225_01&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, and finally,
- [Windows' built-in Video Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/photo-movie-editor){:target="_blank"}, formally MovieMaker.

These are my findings.

1. Most of the software claim to be free but upsell you on advertisements and special features. Only DaVinci Resolve and Windows Video Editor are free in the true sense.

2. None of the software is truly [cross-platform](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/17056/cross-platform){:target="_blank"}. Only DaVinci Resolve comes close, but currently have issues with importing mp4 clips on Linux. KdenLive is a good alternative, and it is open source.

3. I found InShot to be the best, non-intrusive, easy-to-use for the Android platform.

4. On Windows, it might be surprising but the Windows Video Editor is totally sufficient for most use for any newbie who just wants to put together clips to make a simple video. However, with some creativity, it can make something really good. I think Windows is trying to make something close to [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/){:target="_blank"} on [IOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-13/){:target="_blank"} here and I am really impressed. If you want more features, you should surely check out DaVinci Resolve. It is surely a professional-grade software comparable to Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro (even the free version).

5. Apple users have a great advantage as they have in-built software for most creative uses such as this. I have not personally used any Apple product but I know there are iMovie and [Garageband](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/){:target="_blank"} for both video and music editing respectively, all free.

6. DaVinci Resolve is MY all-around best. It is professional, feature-rich, free, no upselling and still improving. The only cons are; it might be intimidating for total newbies, not available on mobile, it is resource-hungry (what do you expect).

This is a quick one. Let me know what you think or if you have a different opinion or experience. Did I miss something out? Would you like to see a video on this post? Do let me know in the comments.
